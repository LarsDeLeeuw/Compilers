# Compilers

My grammar is in src/Grammar.g4,
    
To run python main.py input.c

TODO: Throw syntax error when break or continue statement not in loop/switch scope
      Implement DeadCode/Unreachable Code, my break and continue depend on it, break/return/continueStmt node should be last stmtnode of a scope
      forwardDeclaration.c works but is not fully implemented yet for example arguments arent checked yet when init an decl function
      Need to implement for-loop
      Need to add type implicitcasts for binaryop expr
      

Grammar:
      TODO: 
            * Add const support.
            * Add unnamed scope support, should not be allot of work. These are illegal in global scope. But could recognise them and throw sementic error after.
            * Add For-loop support, should be straightforward if I can create a while-loop that does the same thing.
            * (Optional) Maybe implement switch, can be converted to if-else so not allot of work.

## Visualisation

My compiler provides the option to generate a visualisation of the generated AST and STT. 
This visualisation returns two formats: the structure in dot format and a jpg interpreted from the dot file
Disclaimer, this visualisation is a dev feature and I don't guarantee that the generated visualisation 
matches the structure perfectly. For example the VarDeclNode of the AST appears to have 3 seperate children: 
it's type, it's identifier and the init_expr. But in reality the only child of the VarDeclNode is the init_expr.
