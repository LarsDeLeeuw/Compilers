# Compilers
Compiler project created for the course Compilers at the University of Antwerp.
CURRENT VERSION IS A MESS. PLEASE READ THE EMAIL I SENT TO brent.vanbladel@uantwerpen.be

My grammar is in src/Grammar.g4,

The rest is bits and pieces of different assignments, in the email I will provide context.


# About
This compiler is written in python and attempts to succesfully compile a subset of the C language to MIPS instructions using ANTLR.
