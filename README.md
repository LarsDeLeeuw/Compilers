# Compilers

My grammar is in src/Grammar.g4,
    
To run python main.py input.c

TODO: Throw syntax error when break or continue statement not in loop/switch scope
      Implement DeadCode/Unreachable Code, my break and continue depend on it, break/return/continueStmt node should be last stmtnode of a scope
      forwardDeclaration.c works but is not fully implemented yet for example arguments arent checked yet when init an decl function
      Need to implement for-loop
      Need to add type implicitcasts for binaryop expr
      

Grammar:
      TODO: 
            * Add const support.
            * Add unnamed scope support, should not be allot of work. These are illegal in global scope. But could recognise them and throw sementic error after.
            * Add For-loop support, should be straightforward if I can create a while-loop that does the same thing.
            * (Optional) Maybe implement switch, can be converted to if-else so not allot of work.
